## About

I created this start page to make my computer's theme look more integrated. I built it using React. I encourage you to fork it and make your own version -- it's something to do if you're out of ideas. Keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. I will be adding a customized search bar to it and an easier way of adding links using Firebase. 

My computer runs on the excellent [ArchLabs Linux](http://archlabslinux.com). Since it doesn't use a desktop environment (only [i3-gaps](http://https://github.com/Airblader/i3)), I created a home page for my browser so that my software looks more deliberately themed.

The font is _Ubuntu Mono_. The bar on top is [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/). The gif is something I found in [r/glitchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art/comments/60u5q0/smoking_girl/) that caught my eye.
